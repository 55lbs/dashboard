They will then have 10 seconds to transition to the next barbell where the same requirements apply. They may make only one thruster attempt in any 20 second period. An attempt is defined by the barbell leaving the shoulders after the squat. If an athlete drops the barbell before an attempt is made, he or she may make take the barbell from the floor again. There will be 15 barbells. Athletes continue so long as they successfully perform the rep within the 20 seconds. Their result is the weight of their heaviest successful thruster. If an athlete is not able to complete a successful thruster with the first barbell, they receive a DNF and are eliminated from the competition.","sugarword_id":"WjrOyQZLo2","subtype_name":"Reebok CrossFit Games 2011","coach_notes":null,"athletes_notes":null,"movement_ids":["e1XFB3PF7Q"],"updated_at":"2023-11-29 10:30:04.548964+00"}
