Lengths on the floor will also need to be measured and marked for the handstand\\nwalk. This workout begins with the barbell on the floor and the athlete standing tall. After the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete may perform 21 deadlifts, then move to the wall for 21 handstand push-ups, then complete 15 deadlifts and 15 handstand push-ups, then 9 deadlifts and 9 handstand push-ups. The athlete may then move on to the heavier barbell to complete 21 deadlifts, a 50-ft. handstand walk, 15 deadlifts, another 50-ft. handstand walk, and finally, 9 deadlifts and a third 50-ft. handstand walk. The athlete’s score will be the time it takes to complete the workout or the total number of repetitions completed before the 9-minute time cap.  Each completed 5-foot section of the handstand walk will count as 1 rep.\\n\\n","movement_ids":["r3CNRMSi8j","aPz3tX2Uwh","r5pboqWEba"],"updated_at":"2023-11-29 10:30:04.548964+00"}
