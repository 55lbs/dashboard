This workout begins with the barbell on the floor and the athlete standing tall. After the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete may perform 10 snatches and 12 bar-facing burpees for 3 rounds. Upon completion of the first couplet, the athlete MUST rest 3 minutes while the clock continues to run. The athlete then may continue to the second portion of the workout: 3 rounds of 10 bar muscle-ups and 12 bar-facing burpees.  \\n\\nThe athlete’s score will be the total time it takes to complete the entire workout or the total number of repetitions completed before the 12-minute time cap.\\n\\nIf the athlete doesn't complete the first couplet until after the 9-minute mark, their workout is over.
