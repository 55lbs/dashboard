Athletes will have a 20-second window to attempt their max snatch, with only two athletes lifting at a time. At the call of \"3-2-1 … lift,\" the first two athletes may begin their attempts. The snatch must be locked out and completed within the 20-second window prior to the call of \"3-2-1 …lift,\" for the next set of athletes. After all athletes have made an attempt, each will then have another 20-second window to make another attempt, starting back with the first two athletes and rotating through in the same fashion. Athletes will have 80 seconds rest between their first window and their second window.\\n\\nAthletes may load the barbell to whatever weight they choose prior to their first window and during their rest period. If a snatch is missed, the athlete may immediately re-attempt, but the lift must be complete before the end of the 20-second window to count.","movement_ids":["Hcl7kgiTPB"],"updated_at":"2023-11-29 10:30:04.548964+00"}
